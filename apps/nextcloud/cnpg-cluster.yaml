  # PostgreSQL major version is usually determined by the operator's default
  # or can be specified with `imageName` or `imageTag` if you need a specific version.
  # Refer to the CNPG documentation for how to specify PostgreSQL versions if needed.
  # e.g., imageName: "ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:15.6" (check for current supported images)

  # Initial database and owner setup during bootstrap
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: nextcloud
      owner: nextcloud
      # The password for this 'gitlab' user will be auto-generated by CNPG
      # and stored in a Kubernetes Secret named '<cluster-name>-app'
      # You can also specify encoding, locale, etc. here if needed.

  # Optional: PostgreSQL Parameters (uncomment and adjust as needed)

  # Optional: Monitoring (if you have Prometheus Operator installed)
  # monitoring:
  #   enablePodMonitor: true

  # Optional but Highly Recommended: Backup Configuration
  # (This is a basic example; configure Barman object store for proper backups)
  # backup:
  #   target: primary # Take backups from the primary instance
  #   barmanObjectStore:
  #     destinationPath: "s3://your-s3-backup-bucket/gitlab-db/" # Your S3 bucket and path
  #     s3Credentials:
  #       accessKeyId:
  #         name: gitlab-db-backup-s3-creds # Name of a K8s Secret holding AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  #         key: aws_access_key_id
  #       secretAccessKey:
  #         name: gitlab-db-backup-s3-creds # Name of a K8s Secret holding AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  #     # endpointURL: "https://s3.your-region.amazonaws.com" # if not using AWS default S3 endpoint
  #     # WAL settings also go here for Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
  #   retentionPolicy: "14d" # Keep backups for 14 days
